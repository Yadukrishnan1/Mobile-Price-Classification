# Mobile-Price-Classification

The pricing of a product is a fundamental and crucial part of a business model. This is the process where a company decides the price of their product by taking into consideration the cost of goods, manufacturing, market type, quality and competition. In this project, we implemented machine learning algorithms to effectively predict the prices of mobile phones based on existing data from the current market. 

The methods used are:

1) Bayesian Classifier (I, II and III)
2) kNN
3) Support Vector Machines (Used Scikitlearn)
4) Back Propagated Neural Network (Used Scikitlearn)
